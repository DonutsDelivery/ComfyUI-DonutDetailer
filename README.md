This is an experimental node I made to mimick the "adjust" in A1111 Supermerger (https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-supermerger?tab=readme-ov-file#adjust). It adds more noise and texture to the output, and can also adjust gamma/brightness using the last parameter.

Donut Detailer: Initial try at making the node, dosent mimick supermerger accurately. 

Donut Detailer 2: Mimicks closes Supermerger Adjust parameters. 

Donut Detailer 4: Making it more barebone, without the coefficients. 

Thanks to epiTune for helping me make this, and ChatGPT. Note: epiTune does not think this is the best solution to adding more texture as it is a a crude way of modifying the model, use it sparingly.
